  Hello, I'm Chan Yong Shin, working as a CTO for a startup called Mondeique. I like to develop quietly in a place where no one is around at dawn, 
  but I enjoy communicating with people at the same time. 
  MBTI goes back and forth between ENFJ and ENFP. 
  
  We are confident that future online shopping will be done through virtual fitting developed by our company.
  
  I am a full-stack AI developer who can develop Frontend IOS using Swift from backend server development.
  
  
  I am skilled at <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Tensorflow</mark> <mark>Pytorch</mark> <mark>Keras</mark> <mark>OpenCV</mark> <mark>Django</mark> <mark>Swift</mark> 
  <mark>MATLAB</mark> <mark>Docker</mark>

          I worked as an intern in Korean OCR at Mathpresso, a startup that created an application called "QandA," an educational platform that has become the world's No. 1 with huge 
          investment.
          
          In fact, the company proceeded from the beginning to the end of the process from preprocessing data to using it for learning. 
          It wasn't enough to replace Google API, but I've experienced the same performance.
