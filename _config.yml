  Hello, I'm Chan Yeong Shin, working as a CTO for a startup called Mondeique. I like to develop quietly in a place where no one is around at dawn, 
  but I enjoy communicating with people at the same time. 
  
  MBTI goes back and forth between ENFJ and ENFP. 
  
  We are confident that future online shopping will be done through virtual fitting developed by our company.
  
  I am a full-stack AI developer who can develop Frontend IOS using Swift from backend server development using Django.
  
  
  
  I am skilled at <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Tensorflow</mark> <mark>Pytorch</mark> <mark>Keras</mark> <mark>OpenCV</mark> <mark>Django</mark> <mark>Swift</mark>

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In the "monde" app, you have to image the bag you want to find, so when the handbag image comes in, you have to figure out what color the bag is made of. 
          So I used an open source called colorgram to calculate the ratio of rgb and map it to the color we decided to match the color of our database.

          handbag dataset generation easily by using Django
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The "monde" AI project required a handbag bounding data set and a category labelling dataset. To create a dataset more easily, we developed server using django. 
          After going through the Django study, I made it alone from the bottom to API generation by referring to various references. 
          As a result, we were able to create datasets more easily and reduced the time we could learn.

          multi task learning (MTL) category classification using Tensorflow
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In order to classify various categories of bags, we initially approached multi-label image classification, but we changed multi-task learning because we thought it was more suitable
          for the task. When the bag image of different shapes came in, we proceeded MTL for shape and checked the result.

          Object-Detection API using MSCOCO dataset from Tensorflow & customized object-detection
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In order to perform the "object detection" part in Monde, a women's bag search service through category imaging, a technology to find bags from pictures was needed.
          Accordingly, the performance of various object detection models was evaluated using the Object Detection API using MSCOCO Dataset and fine-tuning was carried out on the
          handbag Dataset built on its own.

          Mathpresso Hangul OCR Project for replacing GoogleOCR API.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs 
          At that time, Mespresso used its own OCR technology for formulas, but still used Google API for Hangeul. The use of the API had to involve cost and needed technology to
          replace it. I took charge of the project alone and proceeded everything from project milestone design to coding and experiment. Baseline was used as a CRNN paper and tried to
          increase performance by inserting attention in addition to cc loss. Better performance than Google API allowed us to change and apply the module, but the performance was the
          same.

          I worked on a project in the CP class in the second semester of 2018. Computer Vision directly implements basic algorithms such as image-based technology and image-based
          technology as MATLAB. In the image base, we implemented not only filtering such as demosaicing and white balancing, but also synthetic technologies such as blending, and we
          also implemented focus-related parts from image photographs. In the video, we proceeded Laplacian Pyramid and Filtering.

          I worked as an intern in Korean OCR at Mathpresso, a startup that created an application called "QandA," an educational platform that has become the world's No. 1 with huge 
          investment.
          
          In fact, the company proceeded from the beginning to the end of the process from preprocessing data to using it for learning. 
          It wasn't enough to replace Google API, but I've experienced the same performance.
